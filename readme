limitations:

- use src attribute instead of name for icons, because using the name would include all icons in the build
   - (and we manually exlude them from the xdc because of that right now in `./create-webxdc.sh`)

- dedicated webxdc-dev tool does not work in codespaces, because it relies on multiple ports
